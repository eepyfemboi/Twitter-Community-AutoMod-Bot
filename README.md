# Twitter-Community-AutoMod-Bot
A super-hacky python script using selenium to create an automod bot for a community on twitter. It probably sucks :&lt;

this probably wont be fully functional for a while, but feel free to contribute a bit if u want to

some of the stuff in here is gonna be based off of [this old code](https://github.com/eepyfemboi/random-scripts-i-made-for-extremely-specific-use-cases-that-you-will-probably-never-encounter/blob/main/twitter_retrieve_community_posts_api_parser_thingie_CLEAN%20-%20Copy.py) so keep that in mind
